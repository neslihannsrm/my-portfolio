        <p> My interest in technology led me to pursue a **Computer Science degree at Dokuz Eylül University** in 2022. Although I couldn't complete my degree, I gained valuable knowledge through courses like **Introduction to Computer Science, Calculus, Discrete Mathematics, and Linear Algebra**. </p> 
        <p> I have hands-on experience in **web development**, working with **JavaScript, HTML, and React** to build interactive, user-friendly web applications. I am passionate about front-end development and constantly strive to enhance my skills through personal projects and learning new technologies. </p> 
        <p> To advance my technical skills, I enrolled in the **"IT - Tech for Women" course at Sundsgården Folkhögskola**, where I received practical training in web development and IT concepts, working on real-world projects and collaborating with others in the tech community. </p> 
        <p> I am a highly motivated individual with a strong work ethic and a love for continuous learning. I also have a passion for creativity, which I express through **painting and music**, bringing a unique perspective to my work in technology. </p>
